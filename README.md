# nRF24-Breakout
A nRF24 module breakout to easily interface it with breadboards. Done in KiCad 5.1.9

# About this Project
It's a simple breakout board for connecting nRF24 modules to a breadboard when prototyping. Source files provide the schematics and the custom footprint created. To use, clone the project and open it in KiCad. Check to ensure that the custom component and footprints are present before proceeding. Designed this while learning about PCB design in KiCad via the KiCad like a Pro course by Tech Explorations.
